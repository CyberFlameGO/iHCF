# iHCF - Hardcore Factions Core #
<p>iHCF is a well rounded HCF core developed by primarily by DoctorDark 
for various servers (Para, IPVP, etc). It improves the game-play of factions while increasing 
the challenge of the game.</p>

<p>This plugin is currently not in use by the IPVP network and as such updates and 
 bug fixes may be far and few. I make no promises on the state of the code and it
 being bug free, this repository is primarily for educational purposes. However, 
 reporting issues are always welcome as it allows the community to see what bugs 
 are present in the current build.</p>
